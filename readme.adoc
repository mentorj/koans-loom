# Koans Loom

## Goal

Have an overview of the new Virtual threads from JDK 19
and show most of the API changes.


## Setup

### Install OpenJDK 19 

### Configure your IDE

#### Warning

IntelliJ does not support JDK 19 for the moment so please  switch
to Eclipse 2022.09 for this exercise

#### Javac settings

You should enable preview features for Javac to  be able to run the tests suite


## Working with Koans

All tests (11) are _RED_ initially, just make then pass !!
You should just fix the test , no need to touch to helper class...
